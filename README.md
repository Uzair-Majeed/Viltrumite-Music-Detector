# Viltrumite: High-Fidelity Music Recognition 🎵

Viltrumite is a next-generation music discovery engine designed to identify tracks with extreme precision. Inspired by the logic of Shazam, it leverages advanced acoustic fingerprinting to translate audio waveforms into unique mathematical "fingerprints," specifically tailored for high-fidelity detection and regional music preservation.

## 📦 Getting Started

### **Option 1: Quick Start (Docker)**
The easiest way to run Viltrumite is using Docker Compose.

1.  **Generate a Secret**:
    ```bash
    node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
    ```
2.  **Setup Environment**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env and paste your generated JWT_SECRET
    ```
3.  **Launch**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

### **Option 2: Local Development**
